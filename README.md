This is the repsoitory that I'm using for my CMPE 257 project for my Fall semester in SJSU's computer engineering graduate program. It is for a python-based IDS that uses ML to detect malicious traffic. Please do not use the program within this repository; this is my project that I am making public for the sake of a project portfolio.
